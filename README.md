# Sunrise

Personal project to learn game development and try out new things.

Currently has the following:
- Procedural generated map - Each map is procedurally generated everytime the player starts the map
- Basic AI - Melee AI that wander around the map. They will chase and attack the player if they see them.
- Objectives - Some keys to pick up and find the exit to finish the level
